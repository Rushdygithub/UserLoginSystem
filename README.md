# UserLoginSystem (Documentation)
This is a user login and registration authentication system. The tech stack is Node, ExpressJs

#Here The Implementation Prosess
1.you should install node js in your computer 
2.Then clone the project from github server
3.After clone the project run this command (npm install) - this will install all dependencies for node js
4. make sure to create database and table : (note:- you need to use only one database for the registration part that's it) (DB:userregistrationdb, table:userregistrationTable with four columns which is id,user,email and password- you can use any name for this part) 


#when you going to build user registration and login system you have to consider about these poits. (to authonticat the system)

#Registration Part:-
User Input Validation:
Validate user inputs on both the client and server sides to prevent malicious data or errors. (Ok)
Check for valid email formats, strong passwords, and any other relevant input constraints. (Ok)

Password Security: 
Implement password hashing using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). (Ok)
Encourage users to use strong passwords and consider enforcing password complexity rules. (Ok)
apply a compare password logic (Ok)

Unique Usernames and Emails:
Ensure that usernames and email addresses are unique to avoid duplicate accounts.(Ok)
Perform database queries to check for existing usernames or emails during registration.(Ok)


#Login Part:-
Authentication:
Implement a secure authentication mechanism, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or sessions.
Verify user credentials against the hashed password stored in the database.

Account Lockout:
Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

Password Reset:
Allow users to reset their passwords securely.
Use a secure token or one-time link sent via email to verify the user's identity before allowing a password reset.

Secure Transmission:
Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmission between the client and server to protect sensitive information during login.

Logging:
Implement comprehensive logging to track login attempts, errors, and other security-related events.
Monitor and log security events for potential threats.
